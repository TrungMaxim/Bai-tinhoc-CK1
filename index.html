      <h2>
        WESTERN CLASSICAL MUSIC IN LATE-ROMANTICISM & THE EARLY TWENTIETH
        CENTURY
      </h2>
      <p><i>A brief history</i></p>

      <div class="w3-justify">
        <p>
          The late 19th and early 20th centuries were a tumultuous and
          transformative period for Western classical music, marking a decisive
          move away from the established traditions of the Romantic era toward
          the radical experiments of Modernism. This period was characterized by
          a profound shift in musical ideology, where composers questioned the
          foundational principles of composition that had governed Western music
          for centuries, especially the system of tonality. Driven by a desire
          for fresh expression, a rejection of the emotional saturation of Late
          Romanticism, and influenced by parallel movements in art and
          literature, musicians sought new sonic languages. This was not a
          unified march into one new style, but rather a vibrant splintering
          into multiple, often contradictory, directions—Impressionism,
          Expressionism, and various national schools—all vying to define the
          sound of the new century. The quest for originality and a complete
          break from the past often led composers to explore non-Western scales,
          revive medieval modes, and, most controversially, abandon the
          tonic-dominant hierarchy altogether.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the first significant departures from German-centric
          Romanticism was the rise of Impressionism in France, spearheaded by
          Claude Debussy and followed by Maurice Ravel. Debussy, in particular,
          sought to evoke moods, atmospheres, and sensations rather than express
          overt emotion or adhere to strict narrative programs. This approach
          drew inspiration from Impressionist painters like Monet, valuing the
          fleeting "impression" over detailed representation. To achieve this,
          Impressionist composers deliberately strayed from traditional
          tonality. Debussy utilized non-functional harmony, where chords were
          often used for their timbre (tone color) and not to drive harmonic
          progression towards a resolution. He frequently employed exotic scales
          like the whole-tone scale (which lacks the half-steps necessary for a
          strong sense of tonic) and the pentatonic scale, creating a sense of
          harmonic ambiguity and fluidity. This blurring of the tonal center and
          emphasis on orchestral color—using instruments like the harp, muted
          brass, and divided strings in novel ways—created a sound world
          described as misty, dreamy, and evocative, as heard in seminal works
          like Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune and Ravel's Jeux
          d'eau. . Across Europe, Russian composer Alexander Scriabin
          (1872–1915) followed a highly individual and mystical path that also
          undermined traditional tonality, though independently of the French
          Impressionists. Scriabin's journey from a Chopin-influenced Late
          Romantic style led to a unique, increasingly dissonant language
          governed by his own metaphysical and synesthetic beliefs. His later
          works, like Prometheus: The Poem of Fire, utilized a complex,
          self-derived sonority known as the "Mystic Chord" (a six-note chord
          built on fourths), creating a highly chromatically dense and ecstatic
          sound that was not entirely atonal but definitely transcended the
          common practice period's definition of key, pushing harmonic
          boundaries to their breaking point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Simultaneously, a more radical break was formalized in Vienna by
          Arnold Schoenberg and his students, Alban Berg and Anton Webern,
          collectively known as the Second Viennese School. Driven by the
          artistic ideology of Expressionism, which sought to express intense,
          subjective, and often turbulent inner psychological states, Schoenberg
          felt that the late Romantic trend of perpetual chromaticism had fully
          exhausted the possibilities of the traditional tonal system. He
          declared the "Emancipation of the Dissonance," asserting that
          dissonant chords no longer needed to resolve to consonant ones,
          allowing them to function as independent, expressive entities. This
          led to a period of atonality (or 'pantonal' music), characterized by a
          lack of a central key, as seen in works like Schoenberg's Pierrot
          Lunaire. Realizing that total freedom often led to structural chaos,
          Schoenberg later systematized his atonal language by developing the
          Twelve-Tone Technique (or Dodecaphony) around 1923. This method uses a
          specific, ordered sequence of all twelve notes of the chromatic scale
          (the tone row) as the basis for a composition, ensuring that no single
          pitch is emphasized enough to establish a tonal center, thus
          maintaining an egalitarian and atonal relationship between all notes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet, amidst these revolutionary movements, the grand, emotionally
          expansive style of Late Romanticism persisted, championed by composers
          who believed in the continued expressive power of tonality. Figures
          like Sergei Rachmaninoff, Nikolai Medtner, Sergei Bortkiewicz, and
          later, Erich Wolfgang Korngold (particularly in his film scores),
          upheld the ideals of Tchaikovsky and Mahler. They continued to write
          in a lush, harmonically rich, and lyrical style, demonstrating that
          the appeal of a clear emotional narrative, soaring melody, and
          functional harmony was far from dead. Rachmaninoff, often described as
          the "last great Romantic," composed powerful works like his Second
          Piano Concerto and Symphonic Dances well into the 20th century,
          cementing the co-existence of radically new and staunchly traditional
          compositional approaches in the modernist era.
